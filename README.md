## Version checking

- If your version is behind, you‚Äôll see this **popup**:

> ‚ÄúYour version is not the latest version. For the latest version and features please download a new version from https://github.com/Comrob2018/QuizApp/tree/main‚Äù

- Remote file (default):  
  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Comrob2018/QuizApp/main/VERSION`  
  (Change this URL in code if you store version metadata elsewhere.)

### Offline behavior
If the version file can‚Äôt be fetched (offline / rate limited), the app continues without warning or delay.
